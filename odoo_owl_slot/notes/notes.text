default props are overwritten when new props are passed

two case were slots can be helpful:

1. when we want to show something in the child component but don't know the content yet.it may be passed on from the parent component.
   here we set a slot in the child component and pass the slot data from the parent component.
2. when we want to loop through parent component's data and pass it to child component using scope.
